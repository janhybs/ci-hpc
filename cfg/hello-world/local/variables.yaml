# supported variables types are strings and numbers (for now)

# you can also specify conditional variables based on computer hostname value
# you can use * (asterisk) wildcar if you do not know precisely what hostname
# will have your computing node 
# The following will match any value starting with:
#   charon
# and ending with:
#   .nti.tul.cz
# i.e. charon10.nti.tul.cz or charon6.nti.tul.cz will match
# 
# non-conditional variables will be overridden if the name is the same as conditional variables
charon*.nti.tul.cz:
  hello-world-workdir: /storage/praha1/home/jan-hybs/projects/ci-hpc/projects/hello-world



# do not forget YAML is a superset of JSON
# so to use wildcar at the beginning of the name, use quotes!
# the following will match any hostname containing . (dot):
#
#   '*.*':
#     foo: bar
# usually HPC hostnames contain a . (dot)
'*.*':
