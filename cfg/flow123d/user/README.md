# Benchmark configuration

This folder contains `yaml` configuration files, which are useful for the
developers in order to control benchmark set which will be used.

 1. `mesh-download-list.yaml`
 
    a configuration file which contains list of files, which are to be
    downloaded from the `astra.cxi.tul.cz` server (such as large meshes).
 
 2. `benchmark-list.yaml` 
 
    a configuration file which contains benchmarks which are to be
    executed and also benchmark-related fields (such as which mesh
    is to be used, how many cores to use, and whether to mark the
    test ans *strong* or *weak* scaled one).
